This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy: improper null handling. The `myMethod` function fails to handle null inputs correctly.  Instead of returning null (which can lead to unexpected behavior downstream), it should explicitly throw an exception, indicating a problem with the input data. The solution demonstrates how to improve this by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`.
